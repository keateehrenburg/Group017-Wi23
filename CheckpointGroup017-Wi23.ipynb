    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to examine the effectiveness of different models in predicting the outcome of a chess match. The data used in this project will contain features describing players’ technical skill and experience including the Elo rating of each player, the number of games they have played, the number of wins/losses/draws they have achieved, their age, and the length of the game. These are measured by observing the outcomes of every game in a player’s career. We will use this data to perform feature selection and single out the most relevant features, and then we will train the models and compare their predictive accuracies. Accuracy will be measured by classification error metrics including precision, recall, f1-score, and possibly others, which we will compare across models to observe their relative efficacies."

    "\n",
    "Within the world of chess competitions and general play, machine learning and deep learning have been famously applied in such algorithms as Deep Blue, Stockfish, etc. These algorithms historically have aimed to predict the next best move to be executed as well as the win probability at any given position state [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11602.pdf) . This win probability is what we aim to place our project emphasis upon as in similar works in varying competitive settings, most relevant of which is found in esports win/loss classification based upon player/team rankings and typical movesets among many other features [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02799.pdf). The application of these algorithms in returning win probability and outcome prediction has large impacts in the way one chooses to learn chess or the way in which a machine is taught how to play chess. This may also have implications for the way in which new strategies or entire play styles are formed. These implications have already manifested themselves in the competitive playspace as many players look towards Stockfish evaluations for input on their play or for other engines in which competition may aid in their training as “with the help of chess engines, Grandmasters are now able to plan prepare for their games in extreme depth, sometimes memorizing up to 15-20 moves of their openings” [3](https://fluency.mcsaatchi.com/2022/09/01/the-evolution-of-chess-ai/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20has%20completely%20changed,20%20moves%20of%20their%20openings.)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we will be aiming to address is determining which machine learning method best predicts the winner of a chess game depending on variables like participating players, player statistics and scores such as their Elo’s, the opening, and psychological factors of the players, among others. We plan to explore this problem by trying three different machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, and deep neural network. Logistic regression is a solid classification method. While we fear that it may be too simple for this task, we believe it is a simple baseline to compare with other, more complex models. We plan to try random forests because the complex decision boundaries may be sufficient for consistently accurate and generalizable predictions. Finally, we plan on using a deep neural network because it seems to be the baseline method used for very similar problems, and given our large dataset, we hope it will pick up on important nuances that are neglected by logistic regression and random forest. We will use labeled chess game data that denotes the winner of each game as well as the aforementioned variables that describe the game. Each model will be trained using the same (or similar) dataset and evaluated with the same set of classification error metrics such that we can compare their efficacies. These metrics include precision, recall, f1-score, and others."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "## NEEDS UPDATE: \"Needs to provide the reference link and some context of \"\"Sayon Bhattacharjee’s LSTM solution\"\". What is it and how will it measure the effectiveness of your model?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of three different machine learning implementations at classifying the outcomes of FIDE titled chess games from unlabeled match data. Each model (Logisitc Regression, Random Forests, and the Deep NN) will be trained on a curated sample database consisting of several derived features representing characteristics of the games pertinent to the games’ outcomes. For this we will need to use a variety of tools for accessing and manipulating the data to generate these special features. Pandas and numpy will be instrumental in this preprocessing stage. Further imports will be required for sklearn and matplot lib for training/validation and analysis, as well as an additional library called pychess will be necessary for processing chess engine ratings and to help format game data for preprocessing. We will be using built in methods for training and validating data provided to us by sklearn. To measure the effectiveness of our model we will take Sayon Bhattacharjee’s LSTM solution published in the _Towards Data Science_ article found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-professional-players-chess-moves-with-deep-learning-9de6e305109e).

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evaluation of binary chess outcome classification, simply implementing a confusion matrix of our algorithm’s results is most appropriate for visualizing the performance. In this situation, there is equal cost associated with both false positive rates and false negative rates, and there is equal cost associated with true positives and true negative rates. Consequently, we care about both the recall and precision of our models equally. This suggests that an f1-score is one primary metric we should use, since it is equally sensitive to both recall and precision. For example, predicting that Player 1 wins when they actually win is equally as important as being ‘accurate’ when predicting that Player 1 will win; the cost of a false positive is no different than the cost of a false negative. We may also explore some other classification error metrics such as likelihood ratios.\n",

    "# Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "In the case of data privacy, we see no major concerns with our data as it is publicly available FIDE match information that is made public anytime a chess player agrees to a FIDE match. The biggest ethical concern that we could potentially see with the production of any well-functioning model for predicting FIDE titled chess matches would be the use of the model for gambling purposes. Although we don't foresee the prediction accuracy of our models being able to give a definitive answer to who will win a match, a good model could lead to an increase in chess match gambling which comes with its own host of harmful consequences. Additionally, we can highlight the concern that a prediction model could affect the way that players go about their matches if they know the predicted outcome of a game given specific features. This could be seen as an unfair advantage. The model, if then re-trained with new data, could also perform much more poorly as outcomes would now be affected by prior knowledge of the potential outcome of a game which would complicate further predictions."
